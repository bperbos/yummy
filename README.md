‚ö†Ô∏è Perf is quite poor - the free fly.io plan with its 256mb of ram for web & postgres hurts

# README
Using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), docker, typescript, postgres.

`rails db:seed` reads the content of recipes-en.json and dumps it into the db.

There are only two integration tests so far - don't shoot, I can explain üò∂

The db schema is as simple as a single table representing the json content from allrecipes, the search work is done by the full text search capabilities of postgres merging multiple fields.

```
rbenv install
nvm install
npm i -g yarn
docker-compose up
bin/rails db:prepare
bin/dev
```
